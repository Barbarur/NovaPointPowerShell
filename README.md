# NovaPointPowerShell

**NovaPointPowerShell** is a sister project of [NovaPoint](https://github.com/Barbarur/NovaPoint), which also intends also to provide a collection of *Solutions* in the form of ready to use PowerShell scripts mainly for SharePoint Admins and Site Collection Admins to manage their Sites, though it also includes *Solutions* for other Microsoft 365 products.

This project also includes helpful collection of *Troubleshooting* information which is not cover by the Microsoft documentation, though it has been proved useful at personal experience. The steps here can directly solve your issue, provide more information to help you to find your own solution or streamline data collection on the issue if needed to open a ticket with Microsoft Support.

## How to use

This project is design as Documentation/Notebook made of markdown pages, each focus on a specific *Solution* or *Troubleshoot*. Frequently you will find pages various options for a specific topic in the same page. Here is how you can access the information of this project:

- Using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) (**Recommended**); Download this project, unzip the downloaded file and use obsidian to open the project folder as new Vault (this is how Obsidian calls *notebooks*). Main benefits are the easy manage of *Tags* and the *Outline content* for each page.

- Using **Go to File**; GitHub comes with the search option *Go to file* for finding correct page. Although lacking of more robust filtering functionality, it can read the *Tags* added to each pages providing accurate results.
